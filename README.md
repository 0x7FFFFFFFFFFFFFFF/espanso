# Espanso Windows Portable Fork

This fork aims to make Espanso portable on Windows.

## Features

- **Portable Installation:** You can rename the executable to anything you like.
- **Self-Contained Config:** Place a configuration file with the same name as the executable (e.g., `my_espanso.yml` next to `my_espanso.exe`) in the same directory, and it will be used automatically.
- **No Installation Requirement:** Simply drop the executable and config in a directory that is in PATH, then run it.
